### Unit Four Here We Come!
Guess what? It is the final unit of WDI before you officially cross the threshold into the tech industry! Holy cow!

To prepare you, this unit is structured unlike any other unit. Instead of being assigned daily homework, you will spend the next two weeks building, tweaking, and deploying applications (new and old).

During this time, you are expected to deliver three applications (**each in their own git repo**):
  * Personal Portfolio Website
  * Rails CRUD Application
  * Independent Application of your choosing

See below for more details!

### Required Applications:

1.  Do these ASAP!!! 
    * **Rails CRUD Application** _with at least 2 related models_ in your database. (**due on Fri, 2/14**)
    * **Personal Portfolio Website**(suggested due date 10/10/2017), which must include:
      * 4-5 Completed Projects with links to the github/deployed version
      * Be under a professional domain name
      * Mobile First Design
      * Clean Commented Code

2. **Independent Application**: Using any pattern and tech stack of your choice, create an application that can be used as a portfolio piece and presented during our cohort **final project science fair**! (**Wed Feb 28th 12:30 - 1:30**)
> Note: The aim for the final project is to build something that will push you. Try to think of a project that interests you. The requirements are fairly relaxed (e.g. you can use any tech stack you want). A typical project would be a full stack CRUD app that uses one front-end framework and one 3rd party API.

#### Squad Leads:

You will meet with your squad lead every morning and do check in and answer the questions: 
* What have you accomplished yesterday?
* What do you plan to deliver by the end of the day?
* What a some challenges? And what resources are needed to overcome them? 

### Expectations
---
To get through the above requirements will take time management, dedication, and passion. It is also a **graduation requirement that all of the tasks above are completed,** so make sure to take this seriously.

Every minute over the next couple of weeks must be planned/used wisely, so jump in and make us proud. We believe in you!!!

## A Note on Plagiarism

General Assembly has a **zero tolerance policy** towards plagiarism and cheating. It is destructive to classroom culture, and exhibits a clear lack of respect for classmates, instructors, the company, and the greater community. Any work considered to have been plagiarised will not be accepted and will not count towards graduation requirements. If a project exhibits evidence of plagiarism or cheating, the student will not be able to display the project at a GA-sponsored class “science fair” or “meet & greet.” Any student found plagiarising or attempting to plagiarise will be disciplined accordingly (including but not limited to removal from class).

Open source code is inherently open and usually available for free use to modify and implement into any non-commercial project. However, please review their license and usage guidelines, give credit to the project and/or author, and do not try to hide or disguise the usage of such code.

You are encouraged to ask others, including students, instructors, and stackoverflow, for help. However, it is NOT ACCEPTABLE TO COPY another person's code and submit it as your own. More importantly, it is detrimental to your learning and growth.

All of the following are considered plagiarism or cheating:
- Turning in work that is not your own.
- Turning in someone else's work as your own.
- Hiring, or paying someone to do your work for you.
- Copying words or code without giving credit.
- Building or copying someone else’s idea without their knowledge or giving credit.
- Giving incorrect information about a source.
- Changing words, variable names, etc. but copying the code or files of a source without giving credit.
- Copying so many ideas or code blocks from a source that it makes up the majority of your work, whether you give credit or not.
- Failing to put a quotation in quotation marks.
